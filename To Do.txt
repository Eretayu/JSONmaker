This is a To Do list of all of the things not yet finish for the Cloud Formation JSONmaker.

- Advanced construction : most
 + essentially everything needs to be done, starting with:
    DONE * The options list:  a list of the ten different parts of the template that the user can change, with movement with arrow keys.
    DONE * The options states/defaults: the options list should have states visible to the user to show if they have finished each option. There should be defaults for all optional parameters, and a way for the user to see these defautls.
    DONE * Classes for each of the ten options, that can be called to modify the template. Ideally there should be one class that interacts with the template, and that class is called by the other ten classes, each of which hold the functions specific to their option.
    * optionExplainer: This is a simple explaination of the option the user is at.
    * make a way for the user to get their final template after reviewing it.

- Prebuilts construction: none
   + an option for the user to select a prebuilt system would be nice. Perhaps this option can be researched.
